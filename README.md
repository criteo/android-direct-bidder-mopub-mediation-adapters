# Criteo Adapters for Mopub Mediation (Android)
This repository contains Criteoâ€™s Adapter for Mopub Mediation. It must be used in conjunction with the Criteo Publisher SDK. For requirements, intructions, and other info, see [Integrating Criteo with Mopub Mediation](https://publisherdocs.criteotilt.com/app/android/mediation/mopub/).

# Download
Add the following maven repository into your top-level *build.gradle* file:

```kotlin
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://pubsdk-bin.criteo.com/publishersdk/android" }
    }
}
```

Then, in your app's module *build.gradle* file, add the following implementation configuration to the *dependencies* section:

```kotlin
implementation 'com.criteo.mediation.mopub:criteo-adapter:3.7.0.0'
```

# Depending on a local version of the SDK

The adapter has a dependency on the SDK. In order to debug, you may have the need to test the
adapter against a local SDK. You can:

## Deploy your own debug SDK in your local maven repository

To use a local SDK as a dependency in this adapter project, you need to publish your local SDK in
the maven local repository. You can then refresh your dependencies, the last version should be
selected, and you will end up with your local version.

```shell script
# Given the mochi folder is next to this adapter folder (and you are at the root of this adapter
# folder)

# A timestamp is automatically added to differentiate between prod and preprod versions.
pushd ../mochi && ./gradlew clean publishToMavenLocal && popd

# It is published, you need to refresh the dependencies
./gradlew clean build --refresh-dependencies
```

If you want to go back on a preprod dependency, you need to clean your maven local repository
(generally located at `~.m2/repository`), and refresh the dependencies.

# Publishing the adapter

## Bumping the version number

The `adapter_base_version` should be bumped in the [project level build.gradle file](build.gradle)

You can also add some words in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

## Building and publishing the adapter to the production repository

```shell script
./scripts/do-release.sh
```

## Publishing the adapter on GitHub
