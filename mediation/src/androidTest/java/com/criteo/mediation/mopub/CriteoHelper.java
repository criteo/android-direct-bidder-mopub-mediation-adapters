   * The Criteo SDK is a singleton that contains some cached data.
   * In order to have isolated test scenario, those cached data should be clean.
   * However, this practice should stay exceptional and should never be done by publishers.
   * Hence, no public API should be developed for that.
   * Also, the Criteo.init method should keep creating only one instance because publishers
   * may call it many times.
   * That's why this is solved with reflection by putting null into the singleton instance holder.
   * Because SDK release artifact is obfuscated by proguard, we cannot directly get the "criteo" field,
   * instead we should loop over the fields and select the static Criteo one.
